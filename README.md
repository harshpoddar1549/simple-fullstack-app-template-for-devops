# simple-fullstack-app-template-for-devops
A simple full stack app template to learn and practically implement devOps quickly without spending any additional time in, first creating an application and then doing the deployment and containerisation part. The repo also contains docker compose file to run the mongo container and mongo-express container. Later I will also add Dockerfile to them
